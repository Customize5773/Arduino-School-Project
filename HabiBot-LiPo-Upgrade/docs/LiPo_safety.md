# Lithium Polymer (LiPo) Battery Safety Protocol

## Critical Handling Procedures
1. **Charging**
   - Always use a **balance charger** specifically designed for LiPo batteries
   - Never charge above `4.20V ± 0.05V per cell`
   - Maximum charge rate: `1C` (e.g., 1000mA for 1000mAh battery)
   - Charge in fireproof LiPo bag on non-flammable surface
   - Never leave charging batteries unattended

2. **Discharging**
   - Never discharge below `3.0V per cell` (6.0V for 2S)
   - Disconnect battery when not in use
   - Monitor voltage during operation (use built-in sensor)

3. **Storage**
   - Store at `3.7-3.9V per cell` (40-60% capacity)
   - Use fireproof storage container
   - Ideal storage temperature: `5-25°C` (41-77°F)

## Warning Signs & Emergency Response
| Symptom | Action | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Swelling** | Isolate immediately → Place in fireproof container | Avoid overcharging |
| **Leaking** | Wear gloves → Dispose at battery facility | Prevent physical damage |
| **Overheating** | Disconnect → Move to safe area | Use proper current rating |
| **Fire** | Use Class D fire extinguisher → Call emergency services | Never puncture batteries |

## Disposal
1. Fully discharge battery in salt water (5% NaCl) for 24 hours
2. Wrap in insulating tape
3. Take to certified battery recycling center

> **Emergency Contacts**  
> US: Call 911 and mention "lithium battery fire"  
> EU: 112 - Request hazardous materials team

## Maintenance Schedule
- Weekly: Visual inspection for damage/swelling
- Monthly: Check cell voltage balance
- Quarterly: Clean connectors with isopropyl alcohol
- Annually: Capacity test (charge/discharge cycle)
